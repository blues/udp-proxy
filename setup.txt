screen -r

# NOTE that when you are in the screen session above, these are
# the absolutely essential things to remember:
ctrl-a d       // Detaches the screen session and returns to bash
ctrl-a <ESC>   // Allows you to use arrow keys to scroll back to

# While you are in the screen session, remember that typing
# the letter 'q' followed by <enter> will quit the session,
# re-pull the latest code from the repo, and restart the
# udp proxy server.  This is the way to re-deploy updates.
